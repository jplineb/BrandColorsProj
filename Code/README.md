## Jetson Nano Startup
The Jetson Nano has a few external peripherials that you must check before turning it on: 
+ The prototype's external 500GB Samsung SSD that *has* to be plugged into a USB port. This external drive is for the Nano's swap file.
+ The logitech wireless dongle for the wireless keyboard
+ An external display. There are two ports for this, you can either use an HDMI cable or Display Port
+ A Webcam if necessary
+  The 20A power supply so that the Nano can receive power

To power on the Nano just plug in the powersupply to an wall outlet and it will start up. The start up processes should take from 15-20 seconds and an Nvidia logo will appear as a splashscreen during such.

Once the Nano is running, a desktop will be shown like below:
